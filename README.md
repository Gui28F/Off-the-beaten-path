# Off-the-beaten-path
When we look at a network of lines, for example at a complex road map with winding lines and crossroads (intersections) all over the place, we can ask ourselves how best to deal with such a complex entity that has no easily identifiable structure. One technique that seems valid is to start by decomposing a complex path into a collection of linear segments where no intersection occurs. Then, we try to solve our hardest problems using the new representation.
